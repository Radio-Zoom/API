# API to Icecast2 and other stuff by Radio-Zoom
The API will provide access to various services such as Iceast2 or NGINX (othery may follow if required). It will grab statistics, META Data such as running song title or listener count.

It's primary focus is the implementation for the Radio DJs of [Radio-Zoom](https://www.radio-zoom.de/) and to publish Data such as Title or current on AIR DJ to our users on our website and witin our web based Radio-Stream Player.

We try to allow every Radio Host/ DJ to use the preferred Software, so any information will be sourced from our servers not from the Software that is in use by the DJ. These tools will work with any Encoder and any Audio Player as long as they allow to set all meta fields and are fully Icecast2 compliant.
We are running Icecast 2.4.3 and all development is tested against this version only.
